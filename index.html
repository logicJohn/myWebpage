            <p><strong>A bit about me:</strong><br>
            By day I work at IBM as a software engineer and attend school at East Carolina University.
            I live in Greenville NC but spent the last several years living in Raleigh NC.
            When I am not writing code and learning magic (aka science) I spend my time playing
            video games and studying martial arts.

        <div class="card aboutMeCardBody">
            <p><strong>Current Mission:</strong> <br>
            Right now I am a Senior at ECU working towards finishing getting my BS in Mathematics
            and Computer Science. In addition while attending school I am working part time with
            IBM as well as spending my free time working on personal coding projects.
            I am also an officer in the ACM and ECU martial arts club.  I donâ€™t know
            where exactly life will lead me after I finish school but I want to make
            sure that I am prepared for any outcome.

            <p><strong>Vision:</strong><br>
            My hope is that one day I can accumulate enough knowledge and experience
            to make a difference in the world. I want to use the technology of tomorrow
            to solve the problems of today. I have a lot of interest in data analysis
            and machine learning so maybe with time I can extend a career in that
            direction but right now my life still has plenty of opportunities so
            we will see what happens.

                    Many of the projects that I work on are for learning purposes, I find the that best way to
                    learn a technology is to learn through doing.

                    Here you can find some various projects that I have worked on in the past or
                    at this point currently at work on. One example is this website which I built as a
                    test to learn html, css, and js.

                    <p>

                        The Eagle Scout award is the highest accomplishment one can attain in scouting.
                        For me this reward exemplifies my devotion to the Scout oath and even more so to the dedication that I have for my community.
                        To always be prepared both mentally and physically, and to always do my kind to those who I meet in life.
